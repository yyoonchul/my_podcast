# My Podcast - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

My Podcast is a personalized podcast application that delivers daily news and career insights tailored to users' interests and professional needs. The application features a modern, responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. In this initial phase, the focus is on building a lean onboarding flowâ€”from landing page through sign-upâ€”with all user data and authentication managed via Firebase. Future complex functionalities (e.g., full podcast generation) can be implemented later using Python/FastAPI if needed.
